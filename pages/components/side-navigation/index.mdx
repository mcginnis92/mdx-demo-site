import SideNav from '../../../site-components/SideNav/Sidenav';
import DocumentationWrapper from '../../../site-components/DocumentationWrapper/DocumentationWrapper'

export const meta = {
  title: 'SideNav',
  description: 'The SideNav component is a form of secondary navigation that allows users to travel between relevant topics within an experience.',
}

export default ({ children }) => <DocumentationWrapper meta={meta}>{children}</DocumentationWrapper>;

<SideNav />

## Principles

1) Discoverable

Make it easy for users to locate the navigation within the page and interact with it.

2)  Contextual

Provide users with an understanding of where they are within a set of pages in the experience.

3) Consistent

Place in-page navigation at the left-hand side of the page in the same position, providing familiar access to relevant content.

## Anatomy
